#I designed a pinyin input method, and needs your help, thx.

# A new pinyin input method from HIT( Harbin Institute of Technology ) #
I want to say that it is my pleasure to do some contribution to my favorite linux distribution.
In windows, there are bits of pinyin ime such as sogou, qq, google and so on. However, in the linux worlds, there is not so many. I just get the idea to design a ime for the linux about two months ago, and I have completed the first release.

As the man page says, it uses statistic language module to generate the sentence corresponding to the pinyin input. The words dictionary comes from sogou partly, and I uses very huge web data to training the language module. There are a lots of features to make it look like sogou input method, and I will introduce them later.

The previous release version is somehow not optimized, and it may take you some time to use to make the machine study effective.

**Thanks a lot** if you can download it and install it, and what's important, report the bug to me. I will fix the bugs and make the input method more and more useful.

**Thx, Thx a lot**
